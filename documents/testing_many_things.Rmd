This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Data Sample -------------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse) 
library(rsample)
set.seed(36802911)
colleges <- read_rds('data/processed/colleges.rds')

colleges <- colleges %>% filter(!is.na(compl_rpy_5yr_rt))



# create a function that take a data column with NAs
# and spits out a column where the nas have been filled 

noNA = function(array){
  # check the type of array
  type <- typeof(array)
  n <- array %>% n_distinct()
  if(type == "double" & n < 6){
    naless = array %>% replace_na(-1)
  }else{
    naless = array
  }
  return(naless)
}


colleges %>% 
  map_df(noNA) %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
colleges %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
